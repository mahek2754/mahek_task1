Name - Mahek Choudhary Roll no.- 220101062 Branch - Computer Science and Engineering

I am from Jaipur, Rajasthan. My hobbies include painting, photography and debating. I am always up for new things to try my hands on and explore different domains.

Contributing to open source allows me to develop new skills, boost my problem solving ability, help me collaborate with a diverse community of developers and learn from their experiences. I want to give back to the community. I may be able to make a positive impact by providing support to users or fixing bugs.
